Or do you want to use both in combination? Then this session is something for you.  <br /> <br />In this session I will build an application using Spring 4, then build  the same application using Java EE 7 and at last build it again using a  combination of the two.  <br /> <br />Strengths and weaknesses with the three approaches will then be explored and lessons learned summarized. <br /> <br />Ivar Grimstad is an experienced software architect with a strong focus on Enterprise Java.   <br /> <br />He has been working with Java since the beginning and has over the years  tried out everything from lightweight mobile applications to large  scale enterprise applications. His experience covers all aspdects of  designing architectures based on a variety of technologies including  standard Java EE as well as more lightweight frameworks such as Spring  and a variety of open source products.   <br /> <br />  Ivar is always focusing on quality and on using the right tools and  technologies for the right task to optimize the software development  process.    <br /> <br />Ivar is a frequent speaker at conferences, locally as well as internationally. Presented in Swedish. <br /><br /><i>Ivar Grimstad, Cybercom"</i></blockquote><br />Java EE7 compability today<br /><ul><li>WildFly</li><li>Glasfish&nbsp;</li><li>and a korean on without documentation.</li></ul>this talks make me wanna code!
